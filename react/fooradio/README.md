# FooRadio

A [radio-browser](https://www.radio-browser.info/) frontend built using React and TypeScript.
[Live version here](https://fooradio.onrender.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses only a single additional Node.js module, `react-router-dom`, for client-side routing. It was made as the final project of [FooCoding](https://www.foocoding.org/), a six-month full-stack web development bootcamp in Malm√∂, Sweden targeted towards immigrants.

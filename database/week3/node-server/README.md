### Todo app database & API server

Import the database from `todo.sql` into your MySQL instance, install the Node dependencies, update `index.js` with your database user credentials and youâ€™re good to go!

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/]() to use the database explorer frontend; the database can be modified with the HTTP requests described in `index.js`.
